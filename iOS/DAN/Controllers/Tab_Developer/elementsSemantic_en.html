        <p>The <span class="italic">accessibilityTraits</span> attribute allows to specify the trait of an element to the accessibility API. Thus, it is possible to make a list item be considered as a button because it is clickable. Therefore, the <span class="italic">accessibilityTrait</span> attribute plays an important role on the element vocalization because the trait is vocalized by VoiceOver.</br></br>
        
        This accessibility attribute is available via the builder interface but also programmatically.</br></br>
        
        There are many available traits. The more commonly used are:</br>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="italic">accessibilityTraitNone</span>: removes any semantic value to the element.</li>
            <li><span class="italic">accessibilityTraitButton</span>: adds the "button" trait, the element is seen as a button by VoiceOver.
            <li><span class="italic">accessibilityTraitLink</span>: useful to define a label as a "link".</li>
            <li><span class="italic">accessibilityTraitHeader</span>Â : defines an element as a header (for more information, see the "titles and headers" section).</li>
            <li><span class="italic">accessibilityTraitAdjustable</span>: defines an element as an "adjustable" element, that is to say an element that users can adjust in a continuous manner, such as a slider or a picker view.</li>
                </ul>
