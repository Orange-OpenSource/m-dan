        <p>Redefining the VoiceOver reading order is done using the <span class="italic">UIAccessibilityContainer</span> protocol. The idea is to have a table of elements that defines the reading order of the elements. It is often very useful to use the <span class="italic">shouldGroupAccessibilityElement</span> attribute so we have a precise order but for a part if the view only (the rest of the view will be read using the 'logical' order).
