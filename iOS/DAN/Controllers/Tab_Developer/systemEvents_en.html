        <p>iOS sends several accessibility events to the applications. They are sent when accessibility options are changed. For example, if VoiceOver is deactivated, the running applications will receive the <span class="italic">UIAccessibilityVoiceOverStatusChanged</span> event. This is very useful when used simultaneously with <span class="italic">UIAccessibilityIsVoiceOverRunning</span>.</br>
        Let's say the application behaves differently when VoiceOver is turned on. This is detected by the <span class="italic">UIAccessibilityIsVoiceOverRunning</span>method. What happens if VoiceOver is disabled? This is when the system events can be used. By listening to these events, it is possible to dynamically change how the application behaves.
