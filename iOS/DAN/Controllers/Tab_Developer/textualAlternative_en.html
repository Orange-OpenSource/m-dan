        <p>On iOS, the vocalization of an element is done through four attributes: <span class="italic">label</span>, <span class="italic">hint</span>, <span class="italic">value</span> and <span class="italic">trait</span>.</br>
        The order of vocalization is always as follows: <span class="italic">label</span>, <span class="italic">value</span>, <span class="italic">trait</span> and <span class="italic">hint</span>. This order cannot be changed and the vocalization is performed only once.</br></br>
        
        A section of this guide is dedicated to the trait, we describe here the other three:</br>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="italic">accessibilityLabel</span>: the <span class="italic">label</span> redefines the text read by VoiceOver. This allows a component to be more explicit than the text displayed on the screen. For example, for a button whose title is "OK", this attribute can indicate that the button is used to confirm an action.</br></li>
            <li><span class="italic">accessibilityValue</span>: the <span class="italic">value</span> valeur of an element is by default the completion percentage (e.g. a progress bar percentage). Note that for most elements available in the SDK, this value does not need to be set (the system automatically sets the value).</br></li>
            <li><span class="italic">accessibilityHint</span>: the <span class="italic">hint</span> pdescribes the component behavior. Example: "click here to get the result".</br></li>
        </ul></br>
        
        These accessibility attributes are available via the builder interface but also programatically. Anything inheriting from <span class="italic">UIView</span> has these attributes by default. These attributes accept an optional string, and are therefore easily localizable.</p>
