        <p>On iOS, it is possible to check the accessibility options state. Is VoiceOver activated? Is the audio-mono mode activated?</br>
        Several methods can help you to check with that. They are part of the <span class="italic">UIKit</span> framework.</br></br>
        
        The most useful method is <span class="italic">UIAccessibilityIsVoiceOverRunning</span> which allows to know wether VoiceOver is activated.
