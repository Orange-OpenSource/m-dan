        <p>It is very easy to trigger vocalizations with VoiceOver. Note that we are talking about VoiceOver vocalization and not TTS (Text To Speech) that can operate whether VoiceOver is on or off.</br></br>
        
        To trigger a vocalization, just call the <span class="italic">UIAccessibilityPostNotification</span> method passing the notification allowing to trigger a vocalization (<span class="italic">UIAccessibilityAnnouncementNotification</span>) and the string to vocalize as parameters.</br></br>
        
        <code>UIAccessibilityPostNotification(UIAccessibilityAnnouncementNotification, @"speakString");</code></br></br>
        
        The vocalization is done in the system language.
