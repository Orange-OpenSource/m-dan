        <p>It is possible via an accessibility attribute to hide elements from accessibility tools (e.g. VoiceOver). By extension, it is possible to force some elements to be visible to accessibility tools.</br></br>
        
        <span class="italic">AccessibilityElement</span>: boolean to specify that an element is visible or not to the Accessibility API (VoiceOver or other).</br>
        <span class="italic">AccessibilityElementIsHidden</span>: boolean to indicate that the children elements of the target element are visible or not to the Accessibility API.</br>
        <span class="italic">AccessibilityViewIsModal</span>: boolean that can make visible or not the sibling elements of the target element to the Accessibility API. Very useful for making accessible custom popin for example.</br></br>
        
        The <span class="italic">accessibilityElement</span> attribute is available via the interface builder but can also be used directly through the code. The other two attributes are available only through the code.</p>
